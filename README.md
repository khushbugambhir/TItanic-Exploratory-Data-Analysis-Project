In this project I analyzed survival patterns using visualizations like histograms, countplots, boxplots, and heatmaps to understand how gender, age, and class affected survival. The objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to identify patterns and factors that influenced passenger survival. 

The dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including:

-PassengerId
-Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
-Pclass (Passenger Class)
-Sex
-Age
-SibSp (Siblings/Spouses aboard)
-Parch (Parents/Children aboard)
-Fare
-Embarked (Port of Embarkation)

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle. 
Tools and libraries used (Python,Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib,Seaborn,Jupyter Notebook

A histogram was used to understand the age distribution of passengers. Most passengers were between 20 and 40 years old, with fewer elderly passengers onboard.
A countplot was created to compare survival rates between male and female passengers. The analysis shows that female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate compared to male passengers.
The analysis shows that passengers in first class had a higher survival rate compared to those in second and third class. This indicates that passenger class played an important role in survival.
A correlation heatmap was used to identify relationships between numerical variables. Survival showed a strong correlation with passenger class and fare, indicating socio-economic factors affected survival chances.
The boxplot shows that the median age of survivors was lower compared to non-survivors, indicating younger passengers had better survival chances.

Females had a higher survival rate than males
Passengers in higher classes survived more
Younger passengers had better survival chances
Fare and class were important factors affecting survival
Exploratory Data Analysis revealed that gender, passenger class, age, and fare played a significant role in determining survival on the Titanic. These insights help understand historical patterns and prepare data for further predictive modeling.
